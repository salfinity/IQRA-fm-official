## **George Floyd's Legacy: A Painful Reflection on Racial Injustice**

_When you take notice of the name George Floyd, what thoughts run through your head? Pain, racial discrimination, retaliation, upheaval, plus the term ‘black lives matter’. Our exertions are usually stricken by what we leave behind, as a father figure we are groomed to protect our own. We urge their comfort by ensuring ease in their path, contrary to that a guardian leaves behind a 6-year-old daughter devoid of a father and a wife with no husband, his demise pact elation in the black community which conveyed revolution to the world._

## **The Echo of "I Can't Breathe": A Peculiar Story of Suffocation**

_Let’s ask ourselves how comes just one more incident was sufficient to trigger us for change with the term “I can’t breathe”.

## **Global Ironies: Democracy, Law Enforcement, and Inequality**

_The Irony of the world we live in is that they preach democracy to the world while their law enforcement is bridging all human rights; claiming to advocate peace, the administration is looting and filled with stains of human blood throughout the African continent and the Middle East; Imposing gender equality and LGBTQ partisan while we segregate people by giving precedence to the white even though we all know the Indigenous of America are not even white?_

## **The Staining Sting of George Floyd's Final Moments**

_What we are left with is a staining sting with vivid motion of poignant pain that succumbed to Floyd at the moment where Derek Chauvin was pressing his knee on his neck, causing chest pains and thirst, curbing him from breathing. The only thing he called out in desperation was “Mama” who died two years ago. This incident brought Law enforcement to their knees at a stance of resonating with the crowd, with passable grounds to wipe off the pandemic hype of Covid 19._

## **Equality or Equity: A Call for Reflection**
