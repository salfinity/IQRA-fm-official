## The Deceptive Facade of Happiness.

Lonesomeness is what furnishes us with dejection of the gloomy reality of what mantles our lives, we believe that depression is seeing someone wearing a low-spirited face filled with sadness yet the opposite might be the reality.

## The Unseen Struggles Behind Smiles.

\*How many of those that we feel are the happy campers and couples who we might consider as goals being cramped with misery despite awe-inspiring admirers might have nevertheless still loneliness curbs them when the cameras are off?

The instant we can be grateful for our health by regarding those who are in Coma or those who have paralyzed, is the moment where we can appreciate our limbs by looking at how those without limbs can survive?
