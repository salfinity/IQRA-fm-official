# Outbreak of Red Eye Disease in Nairobi and Kisii Raises Concerns

The Ministry of Health has raised an alert after confirming three cases of Red Eye Disease in Nairobi, along with an additional case reported in Kisii. Public Health Director General Patrick Amoth provided insights into the situation, emphasizing the need for caution and preventive measures.

## Emergence of Red Eye Disease

The coastal region of Kenya, encompassing Mombasa, Malindi, and Lamu, has witnessed an outbreak of Red Eye Disease, characterized by watery red eyes. According to Amoth, the likely culprit behind the outbreak is the fast-spreading Adenovirus. Despite its rapid transmission, he reassured the public that it typically does not result in long-term complications and is generally self-limiting.

## Key Details and Cautionary Measures

Amoth described the situation as self-limiting, aiming to allay concerns within the community. However, individuals exhibiting severe symptoms such as redness, discharge, swelling, and bleeding are advised to seek urgent medical attention.

To prevent further spread, Kenyans are strongly cautioned against touching the eyes of infected individuals or contaminated surfaces. The Ministry of Health has issued preventive measures, including frequent handwashing and avoiding touching the face. Additionally, sharing towels with family members affected by the disease is discouraged.

## Regional Comparison

The recent spike in Red Eye Disease cases follows a similar health concern in Tanzania. Last week, Tanzanian health authorities issued an alert after recording 869 cases of the disease in a month, predominantly in the commercial city of Dar es Salaam.
