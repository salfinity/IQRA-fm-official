# Petition Filed Seeking Removal Of Chief Justice Martha Koome From Office

A petition has been officially lodged with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), advocating for the removal of Chief Justice Martha Koome from her position. Michael Kojo Otieno, the petitioner, alleges that the Chief Justice violated the law in the appointment of members to the tax appeal tribunal.

According to the petition, Koome, in her role, failed to uphold honesty and transparency in executing powers granted to her by the Tax Appeal Tribunal Act. The document states, _"While appointing persons to serve at the tax appeal tribunal, the judge failed to be honest in the execution of powers conferred to her by the Tax Appeal Tribunal Act based on powers conferred to the judge as a judicial officer..."_

## Allegations Against Chief Justice Koome:

- The CJ was not transparent and diligent in the appointment process.
- Discrimination against applicants for board membership is alleged.
- Chief Justice Koome appointed more members than the stipulated requirement, violating section 4b of the Tax Appeal Tribunal Act.

In light of these accusations, Kojo asserts that Chief Justice Koome is unfit to continue holding office and calls for her removal. He argues, _"The actions of the chief justice in the appointment of the tax appeal tribunal are indeed illegal, null and void and hence unfit to hold public office,"_ as stated in the documents obtained by Citizen Digital.
