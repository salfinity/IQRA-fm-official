## **Present Day Ironies: An Examination by Dr. Mohamed Bahaidar**

**Introduction: Unraveling the Contemporary Paradox**

_What I see in this contemporary generation is an irony of existence. Jumbled with nature, we verify our choices, however, still stranded with our substantial contentment. Through the variety of choices of leisure, we have to pass time in but that doesn’t mean we are at liberty to be blissful in our life. In reality, the opposite might happen._

## **The Illusion of Happiness: Exploring Leisure Choices**

_Let’s just focus on how we have so many options for these entertainments and activities with a question in mind: Why are we still less happy? The world has to turn out to be accessible, and if exotic cuisine is what you’re looking for to pass your time, then its diversity might overwhelm you on how a single click of a button might take you through time and routes on how these foods came about. Yet with all that, the question to ponder, do we have more appetite or less?_

## **Knowledge Overload: The Dilemma of Shallow Minds**

_On the strength of the above, it brings us into our second point: how equipped we can easily be through widespread knowledge? Funny enough, the more know-how we acquire the shallow our minds have become with less creativity. How many of us are ready to waste 20 years in school just to be hired with no initiative to be ingenious with a strategic plan on how to let money work for us instead of the contrary?_

## **Sophistication vs. Happiness: The Gadgets Paradox**

_We have a lot of sophisticated gadgets, but no happiness. A lot of excitement fencing us. Starting from those who see clubbing, drinking, and using substances as part of their amusement to those who have perceived to be Workaholic or Shopaholic as their source of tension discharging. Despite using the art of occupying ourselves and using temporary excitement as happiness, we still are left with a miserable life, a void in us that can’t be tapped._

## **Social Connections: The Deceptive Depth of Digital Bonds**

_We have a lot of interactions as well as followers on social platforms yet we don’t know who our neighbours are as well as being unsure of who is our genuine friend. Life has not only diminished in span but also value and appreciation. Just the fact that we can brag on how we possess tall buildings with peddling treasure that we do not know how to utilize, we are still beached by the fact that we have no one who can listen to us._

## **Time Struggles: Faster Transportation, Less Time**

_Enclosed around individuals who are out of character and bad humour. It should have surprised us just the idea of how transportation and technology are easier and faster, yet we still feel we have very minimum time which leaves us with a lot to do but none to achieve._

## **Personality Incompatibility: The Conundrum of Trends**

_Let’s have a discourse of how we are tangled with the incompatibility of Personality in our society. Just as we have been brainwashed to be certain with the fact that to trend is to be in a state of undress, we live in a generation where no song or movie will ever hit box office unless obscene scenes are involved._

## **Sentiment vs. Smartness: The Cultural Disconnect**

_Flattering with a preconceived notion: don’t use your sentiment you will get hurt, use your mind to find comfort and happiness, is what we are trained to understand. And the fact that cheating on your spouse is a sign of smartness, we have been filled with fear of the word marriage while the concept of come we stay normalized. What we are left within our cohort is the word Love which is very expensive that we can’t afford. The contrast, Sex has become cheap and can be found anywhere…._
